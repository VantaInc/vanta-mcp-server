# Vanta MCP Server Evaluation

This directory contains evaluation tests to validate that the Vanta MCP Server tools are correctly understood and called by AI assistants.

## Overview

The evaluation system tests whether Large Language Models (LLMs) correctly:

- Choose the right tool for compliance-related prompts
- Provide appropriate parameters for each tool
- Avoid calling Vanta tools for non-compliance requests

## Prerequisites

- **OpenAI API Key**: Required to run the evaluation tests
- **Node.js 18+** and **Yarn** installed
- Project dependencies installed (`yarn install`)

## Running the Evaluation

### Method 1: Using yarn script (Recommended)

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"

# Run the evaluation
yarn eval
```

### Method 2: Direct execution

```bash
# Build the project
yarn build

# Set API key and run
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here" node build/eval/eval.js
```

## Test Cases

The evaluation includes 11 test cases covering:

### ✅ **Tool Selection Tests**

- **AWS Security Review**: `get_tests` with AWS and NEEDS_ATTENTION filters
- **SOC2 Compliance**: `get_tests` with SOC2 framework filter
- **Entity Details**: `get_test_entities` for specific failing resources
- **Maintenance Deactivation**: `deactivate_test_entity` for suppressing alerts
- **Framework Listing**: `get_frameworks` for available frameworks
- **Control Requirements**: `get_framework_controls` for specific framework details
- **Status Percentage**: `get_frameworks` for completion percentages
- **Control Listing**: `get_controls` for all security controls
- **Control Tests**: `get_control_tests` for tests validating specific controls

### ❌ **Negative Tests**

- **Programming Questions**: Should NOT call any Vanta tools
- **Code Debugging**: Should NOT call any Vanta tools

## Sample Output

```
🧪 Vanta MCP Server Tool Evaluation
====================================

📝 Test: Should call get_tests with AWS filter and NEEDS_ATTENTION status
💬 Prompt: "What security issues do I have in my AWS infrastructure?"
🎯 Expected Tool: get_tests
✅ PASS: Correctly called get_tests
✅ Parameters match expected values
📋 Called with: {
  "statusFilter": "NEEDS_ATTENTION",
  "integrationFilter": "aws"
}

📊 Final Results
================
✅ Passed: 11/11 tests
❌ Failed: 0/11 tests
📈 Success Rate: 100%
🎉 All tests passed! Tool calling behavior is working correctly.
```

## Understanding Results

### ✅ **PASS**:

- Correct tool was called
- Parameters match expected values (if specified)

### ⚠️ **Partial Pass**:

- Correct tool was called
- Parameters don't exactly match but are functionally correct

### ❌ **FAIL**:

- Wrong tool was called
- No tool was called when one was expected
- Tool was called when none should be

## Customizing Tests

To add new test cases, edit `eval.ts` and add to the `testCases` array:

```typescript
{
  prompt: "Your test prompt here",
  expectedTool: "expected_tool_name", // or "none"
  expectedParams: { param1: "value1" }, // optional
  description: "Description of what should happen"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Error**:

```
Error: OpenAI API key not found
```

**Solution**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set

**Build Error**:

```
Cannot find module 'build/eval/eval.js'
```

**Solution**: Run `yarn build` first

**TypeScript Error**:

```
Type errors in eval.ts
```

**Solution**: Check tool imports and parameter types

### Getting Help

If tests are failing:

1. **Check tool descriptions** in `src/operations/` files
2. **Review test prompts** - ensure they're clear and specific
3. **Validate expected parameters** - ensure they match tool schemas
4. **Test individual prompts** with the OpenAI API directly

## Purpose

This evaluation system helps ensure that:

- **Tool descriptions are clear** and LLM-friendly
- **Real-world prompts** trigger the correct tools
- **Parameter passing** works as expected
- **Scope boundaries** are respected (no tools called for non-compliance queries)

The goal is to maintain high confidence that AI assistants will use the Vanta MCP Server correctly for compliance and security management tasks.
